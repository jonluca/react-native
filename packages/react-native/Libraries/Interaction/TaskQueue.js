 * TaskQueue - A system for queueing and executing a mix of simple callbacks and

 *
 * `enqueue` takes a Task object with either a simple `run` callback, or a
 * `gen` function that returns a `Promise` and puts it in the queue.  If a gen
 * function is supplied, then the promise it returns will block execution of
 * tasks already in the queue until it resolves. This can be used to make sure
 * the first task is fully resolved (including asynchronous dependencies that
 * also schedule more tasks via `enqueue`) before starting on the next task.
 * The `onMoreTasks` constructor argument is used to inform the owner that an
 * async task has resolved and that the queue should be processed again.
 *
 * Note: Tasks are only actually executed with explicit calls to `processNext`.
